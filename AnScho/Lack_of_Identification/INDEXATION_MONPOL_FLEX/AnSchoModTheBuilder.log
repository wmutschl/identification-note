WARNING: Order condition for Komunjer and Ng (2011) failed: There are too many parameters or too few observable variables.
         The number of minimal system elements with non-zero derivative is smaller than the number of parameters.
         Either reduce the list of parameters, or increase number of observables.

Testing prior mean
  
Note that differences in the criteria could be due to numerical settings,
numerical errors or the method used to find problematic parameter sets.
Settings:
    Derivation mode for Jacobians:                         Analytic using sylvester equations
    Method to find problematic parameters:                 Nullspace and multicorrelation coefficients
    Normalize Jacobians:                                   Yes
    Tolerance level for rank computations:                 1e-10
    Tolerance level for selecting nonzero columns:         1e-08
    Tolerance level for selecting nonzero singular values: 1e-03

REDUCED-FORM:
    All parameters are identified in the reduced-form solution (rank(Tau) is full with tol = 1e-10).

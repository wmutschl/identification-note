Testing calibration
WARNING: Komunjer and Ng (2011) failed:
       There are more shocks and measurement errors than observables, this is not implemented (yet).
       Skip identification analysis based on minimal state space system.












  
Note that differences in the criteria could be due to numerical settings,
numerical errors or the method used to find problematic parameter sets.
Settings:
    Derivation mode for Jacobians:                         Analytic using sylvester equations
    Method to find problematic parameters:                 Rank condition on all possible subsets
    Normalize Jacobians:                                   Yes
    Tolerance level for rank computations:                 1e-10
    Tolerance level for selecting nonzero columns:         1e-08
    Tolerance level for selecting nonzero singular values: 1e-03

REDUCED-FORM:
    All parameters are identified in the reduced-form solution (rank(Tau) is full with tol = 1e-10).

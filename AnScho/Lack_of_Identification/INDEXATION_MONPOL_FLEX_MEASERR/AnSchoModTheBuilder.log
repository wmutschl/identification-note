Note that differences in the criteria could be due to numerical settings,
numerical errors or the method used to find problematic parameter sets.
Settings:
    Derivation mode for Jacobians:                         Analytic using sylvester equations
    Method to find problematic parameters:                 Nullspace and multicorrelation coefficients
    Normalize Jacobians:                                   Yes
    Tolerance level for rank computations:                 1e-10
    Tolerance level for selecting nonzero columns:         1e-08
    Tolerance level for selecting nonzero singular values: 1e-03

REDUCED-FORM:

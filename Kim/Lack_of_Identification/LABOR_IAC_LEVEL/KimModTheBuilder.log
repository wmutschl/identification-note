numerical errors or the method used to find problematic parameter sets.
Settings:
    Derivation mode for Jacobians:                         Analytic using sylvester equations
    Method to find problematic parameters:                 Nullspace and multicorrelation coefficients
    Normalize Jacobians:                                   Yes
    Tolerance level for rank computations:                 1e-10
    Tolerance level for selecting nonzero columns:         1e-08
    Tolerance level for selecting nonzero singular values: 1e-03

REDUCED-FORM:
    All parameters are identified in the reduced-form solution (rank(Tau) is full with tol = 1e-10).

ISKREV (2010):
    All parameters are identified in the moments (rank(J) is full with tol = 1e-10).

KOMUNJER AND NG (2011):
    All parameters are identified in the minimal system (rank(D) is full with tol = 1e-10).

QU AND TKACHENKO (2012):
    All parameters are identified in the spectrum (rank(G) is full with tol = 1e-10).

    !!!WARNING!!!
    The rank of G (spectrum) is deficient for 1 out of 100 MC runs (with tol = 1e-10)!

    ALPHA is collinear w.r.t. all other parameters for 1% of MC runs!
    RA is collinear w.r.t. all other parameters for 1% of MC runs!
    DELTA is collinear w.r.t. all other parameters for 1% of MC runs!
    GAMMAL is collinear w.r.t. all other parameters for 1% of MC runs!
